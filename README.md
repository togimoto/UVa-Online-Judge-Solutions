# UVa Online Judge Solutions

This repository contains the code that I have written for UVa Online Judge problems. All of the code here are accepted solutions.

## Usage

The file name of each .cpp file in the folder /src/ corresponds to the problem number. Files with "v2", "v3" etc. in their names usually contain better solutions to the indicated problem. In some cases, I referred to other people's publicly-available solutions to improve on my own solution; in these cases, the references are written at the start of the source code.
